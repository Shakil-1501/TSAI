# Session : 12

## Objective

### Assignment A:

- Download this TINY IMAGENET (Links to an external site.) dataset. 
- Train ResNet18 on this dataset (70/30 split) for 50 Epochs. Target 50%+ Validation Accuracy. 
- Submit Results. Of course, you are using your own package for everything. You can look at this (Links to an external site.) for reference. 

### Assignment B:
- Download 50 images of dogs. 
- Use this (Links to an external site.) to annotate bounding boxes around the dogs.
- Download JSON file. 
- Describe the contents of this JSON file in FULL details (you don't need to describe all 10 instances, anyone would work). 
- Refer to this tutorial (Links to an external site.). Find out the best total numbers of clusters. Upload link to your Colab File uploaded to GitHub. 


### Approach for Assignment A

- The code is made modular by keeping traindatest,testdataset and dataset loader as seperate file
- Downloading TINY IMAGENET dataset 
- Using SGD optimizer and cross EntropyLoss  as loss function
- Using LR Finder as scheduler
- Train Resnet18 on this dataset for 20 epochs.

### Results:

- Accuracy of the Network on the 10000 test images: 53 %

### Approach for Assignment B

### Results

- we can see  no of cluster equal to 7 is the most effective keeping in mind  IOU and through elbow mwthod
