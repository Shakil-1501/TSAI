## REPO Discription

   This repository is all about Computer Vision on Pytorch Framework

## Prerequisite

- Python
- Pytorch and basics of Opencv

<details>
<summary>ML Intituation and basics of CNN</summary>

[Work-Link]()

This describes the very basics of Python, i would recommend binge watching Raymond Hettinger's YouTube Videos, as much as you can, also learn list comprehension, slicing, partial, functools, functional programming, classes, MRO, decorators, lambdas, python 3 typing

Also here i learnt the basics of how a Neural Network learns, how the different channels are formed, what are kernels, how does the DNN make sense of the input it gets, and more !

Have you ever wondered, like why do we only use 3x3 kernels ? i had always wondered, why not 5x5 ? 7x7 ? in this session i learnt why, and how does even the kernel size matter ? why is it only odd numbers ? and why only squares ? and why is 3x3 kernel used twice same as a 5x5 kernel, what is receptive field ?

<summary>Neural Architecture</summary>

[Work-Link]()

This describes the basic neural network architecure, see its page for details

<details>
<summary>Kernels,Convolutions and Activation Function</summary>

[Work-Link]()

Basic Pytorch architecture for working with neural networks, introduces you to nn.Module, optimizers, forward and backward pass, datasets, how to apply simple augmentation.

<summary>Architecture Basics</summary>

[Work-Link]()

Here we had to train MNIST to get 99.4% accuracy with some given contraints, was quite fun to do this, got me out of the noob shell of what a neural network actually is and what it does, because i had to write code manually, not copy paste any more.

<details>
<summary>Model Implementation</summary>

[Work-Link]()

This was very important to realise the basic steps required to make a neural network and then go on to optimize it, to get the perfect model size and accuracy, very important, please see its documentation, and all the notebooks
